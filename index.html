                <h3>A gritty travel wishlist</h3>
                <p>
                    A solo project and my very first full stack app. <i>Gravel Travel</i> is a travel wishlist app where
                    a user can track countries and locations they would like to visit and log trips to locations they
                    have visited.

                <p>
                    Initially completed over just a single week a third of the way into my course at CodeClan. I decided
                    to return to <i>Gravel Travel</i> after graduating as a chance to revisit Python & SQL, apply the
                    knowledge I had gained during the remiainder of the course to overhaul the app as well as to add
                    gain some completely new skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project was a chance to work on object oriented programming with Python, web programming using
                    the model-view-controller design pattern, build RESTful routes and perform CRUD actions with a
                    postgreSQL database.

                <h2>Virtual Art Gallery</h2>
                <h3>Discover Chicago's masterpieces</h3>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript React app using The Art Institute of Chicago's <a
                        href="https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api">public API</a>. Started life as a mob
                    programming exercise to create a multi-component web application with React.js and practice making
                    API requests
                    to load JSON data into an application. The first version was built in a single day with two of my
                    fellow students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I refactored the code as a solo exercise and restyled it in the manner of a work of art hanging on a
                    gallery wall (complete with artwork label). One aspect of the styling that I am particularly proud
                    of is that the wall colour changes to complement the artwork that is loaded.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <h3>The joy of pixels</h3>
                <p>
                    A solo-developed React.js app which creates abstract images via randomly generated coloured dots.
                    <i>Abstract</i> is my first project to be <a href="/Abstract">hosted online</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Abstract</i> began as an experiment to generate abstract images in real-time. The first
                    version poulated a series of &ltdiv&gt elements in random positions on a browser display and
                    unsurprisingly the app performance struggled with higher numbers of &ltdiv&gts. I found an
                    alternative solution by using the &ltcanvas&gt element but enjoyed the &ltdiv&gt aesthetic
                    so tried to retain as much of the original styling as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The newest version of <i>Abstract</i> adds user interactivity via controls to change several input
                    parameters such as dot size or the rate of the colour change. A handful of presets are also available to
                    showcase the different capabilities of the dot generating algorithm.
                </p>
                <div class="image_box" id="image-box-abstract">
                    <img id="abstract-screenshot" class="thumbnail" src="images/Abstact.png">
                    <p class="caption"> Image generation in progress with <i>Abstract</i></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Hosting an app online is certainly a big milestone in the life of a developer, however the deployment 
                    of <i>Abstract</i> brought problems that I was unable to anticipate from the comfort of my own hardware setup. 
                    I made some significant adjustments to the user interface to improve accessibility and user experience. Some of the changes include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>using CSS media queries to adjust the display on smaller screens</li>
                        <li>restyling the buttons to give bigger hit areas</li>
                        <li>relabelling the inputs to better define their purposes</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>AeroSure</h2>
                <h3>Predicting weather-based delays for your flight</h3>
                <p>
                    A full stack React.js app using the Open-Meteo.com <a
                        href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs">Weather Forecast</a> and <a
                        href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api">Geocoding</a> APIs. Produced in a single
                    week as part of a three person group project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>AeroSure</i> is a weather delay prediction tool. The user enters their flight's details (i.e.
                    departure and arrival locations and times). The locations are entered as stings and converted into
                    geographic coordinates using the geocoding API, these coordinates are then fed into the weather API
                    which returns hourly weather forecasts at each location. Logic is then performed which determines if
                    any adverse weather conditions (such as thunder, hail or heavy winds) near the departure and arrival
                    times could cause a delay to the flight. A graded traffic light system is used to output a simple
                    prediction to the user.

                    This was my first app created as part of a team and was a perfect opportuniy to explore agile
                    working methods. Some of the practices we adopted to improve productivity and cohesion were daily
                    stand ups, mob programming and a final project retrospective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Integrating two separate API requests into the logic of the app was a big learning curve and
                    significantly improved my confidence and practical ability of using APIs.
