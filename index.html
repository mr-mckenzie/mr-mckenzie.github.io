                <h2>Gravel Travel</h2>
                <h3>A gritty travel wishlist</h3>
                <p>
                    A solo project and my very first full stack app. Gravel Travel is a travel wishlist app where a user can track countries and locations they would like to visit and log trips to locations they have visited. 
                    <br> <br> 
                    Initially completed over just a single week a third of the way into my course at CodeClan. I decided to return to Gravel Travel after graduating as a chance to revisit Python & SQL, apply the knowledge I had gained during the remiainder of the course to overhaul the app as well as to add gain some completely new skills. 
                    <br> <br> 
                    The project was a chance to work on object oriented programming with Python, web programming using the model-view-controller design pattern, build RESTful routes and perform CRUD actions with a postgreSQL database.
                </p>
                <p>Tech stack: Python, Flask, Jinja, PostgreSQL, CSS, JavaScript</p>

                <h2>Virtual Art Gallery</h2>
                <h3>Discover Chicago's masterpieces</h3>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript React app using The Art Institute of Chicago's public API. Started life as a mob programming
                    exercise to create a multi-component web application with React.js and practice making API requests to load JSON data into an application. The first version was built in a single day with two of my fellow students.
                    <br><br>
                    I refactored the code as a solo exercise and redesigned the styling in the manner of a work of art hanging on a gallery wall (complete with artwork label). One aspect of the styling that I am particularly proud of is that the wall colour changes to complement the artwork that is loaded.
