                <h2>Gravel Travel</h2>
                <h3>A gritty travel wishlist</h3>
                <p>
                    A solo project and my very first full stack app. <i>Gravel Travel</i> is a travel wishlist app where a user can track countries and locations they would like to visit and log trips to locations they have visited. 
                    <br> <br> 
                    Initially completed over just a single week a third of the way into my course at CodeClan. I decided to return to <i>Gravel Travel</i> after graduating as a chance to revisit Python & SQL, apply the knowledge I had gained during the remiainder of the course to overhaul the app as well as to add gain some completely new skills. 
                    <br> <br> 
                    The project was a chance to work on object oriented programming with Python, web programming using the model-view-controller design pattern, build RESTful routes and perform CRUD actions with a postgreSQL database.

                <h2>Virtual Art Gallery</h2>
                <h3>Discover Chicago's masterpieces</h3>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript React app using The Art Institute of Chicago's public API. Started life as a mob programming
                    exercise to create a multi-component web application with React.js and practice making API requests to load JSON data into an application. The first version was built in a single day with two of my fellow students.
                    <br><br>
                    I refactored the code as a solo exercise and restyled it in the manner of a work of art hanging on a gallery wall (complete with artwork label). One aspect of the styling that I am particularly proud of is that the wall colour changes to complement the artwork that is loaded.

                <h2>AeroSure?</h2>
                <h3>Predicting weather-based delays for your flight</h3>
                <p>
                    A full stack React.js app using the Open-Meteo's free <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs">Weather Forecast</a> and <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api">Geocoding</a> APIs. Produced in a single week as part of a three person group project. 
                    <br><br>
                    <i>AeroSure?</i> is a weather delay prediction tool. The user enters their flight's details (i.e. departure and arrival locations and times). The locations are entered as stings and converted into geographic coordinates using the geocoding API, these coordinates are then fed into the forecast API which returns hourly weather forecasts at each location. Logic is then performed which determines if adverse weather conditions (such as thunder, hail or heavy winds) near the departure and arrival times could cause a delay to the flight. A graded traffic light system is used to output a simple prediction to the user.
                    <br><br>
                    This was my first app created as part of a team and was a perfect opportuniy to explore agile working methods. Some of the practices we adopted to improve productivity and cohesion were daily stand ups, mob programming and a final project retrospective.
                    <br><br>
                    Integrating two separate API requests into the logic of the app was a big learning curve and significantly improved my confidence and practical ability of using APIs.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <h3>The joy of pixels</h3>
                <p>
                    A React.js app which draws abstract images via randomly generated coloured brushstrokes. A solo
                    project.
                    <br><br>
                    This small app began as a test to see if I could generate abstract images in real time. The first version used divs and unsurprisingly the browser significantly slowed down once several hundred divs had been generated. Looking for an alternative solution I discovered the canvas element and refactored the code but at the same time tried to keep the aesthetic and feel of the original div based styling.
                    <br><br>
                    I later added some controlls for interactivity that allow the user to change several input parameters such as the size of the generated dots or the frequency of colour cycling.

                <h3>Rate your films and find new favourites</h3>
                <p>
                    Full-stack single-page React.js app for rating films and saving films to a wish list. Generates and
                    outputs stats based on those ratings (such as most watched actors or highest rated genre) which are
                    used to recommend new films to discover. A pair project completed in a two week timeframe.
                    <br><br>
                    This was my first exposure to using external component libraries, which ended up becoming a key feature of the styling of the app.
